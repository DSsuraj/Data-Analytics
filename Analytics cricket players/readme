- if for some reason you have a complete a version to the game of cricket, 
please talk to one of us and choose a different but comparable data set
- else
    - understand the data set by carrying out descriptive analytics 
    - compute basic statistics and plot some graphs and charts  
    - group players into "similar" groups by using any clustering algorithm such as K-Means: 
       you decide which attributes to use, what time periods, what is the value of k, etc.
    - classify the cricket players into the following 6 categories (across formats, i.e., irrespective of ODI/Test/T20):
            1. best batsmen 
            2. good (but not best) batsmen
            3. best bowlers
            4. good (but not best) bowlers
            5. best other contributors
            6. useless fellows

          Define your own criteria/rules for the above 6 categories (but please do state them for us to understand!)

          You may use any classification algorithm to do this (except manually classifying using your human intelligence!)

    - compare the results of clustering and classification to see if clustering "discovered" groups similar to these categories
      or not or anything unusual
