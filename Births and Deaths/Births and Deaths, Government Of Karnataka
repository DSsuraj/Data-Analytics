Please consider the Annual Vital Statistics Report-CRS for the years 2011 through 2016.

You are expected to do the following:

- Extract data accurately from the given PDF files (all of the data or whatever they need for you); 
you should figure out how to do this semi-automatically, i.e., without having to re-type the data
- Load the data into R
- Compute basic statistics for the data using R (i.e., min, max, mean, median, mode, variance, std deviation, IQR, etc.)
- Detect any outliers in the chosen data
- Figure out interesting pieces of information from the given data
- Produce FOUR different plots using R to showcase what you found from the data; any type of plot is OK - simple scatter plots, bar graphs, line graphs, histograms, pie charts, boxplots, QQ plots, cross-tabulations, etc.
- At least one of the plots must be across multiple years
- Add a one-sentence English description of each plot.
